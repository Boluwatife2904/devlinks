# Devlinks

Devlinks is a full stack link-sharing web application for developers!

This is a challenge from [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/linksharing-app-Fbt7yweGsT).

## Deployment

## Stack

This was built using the Technology Stack of Dreams - Nuxt 3, Supabase and Typescript. Other notable mentions are SCSS (BEM methodology), VueDraggableNext, Pinia.

## Features

This is pretty much packed with every basic feature of a link sharing web application

1. Authentication:

    - Sign in/Sign or Email and Password

2. CRUD

    - Create, read, update and delete links
    - Update user profile columns
    - Preview their profile and copy the link to their clipboard so they can share publicly.

3. Miscellaneous
    - Drag and drop for reordering of links

## What I've learnt

During the course of this project, I've learnt and practised to

-   Use mixins for reusability and the SCSS 7-1 architecture
-   Integrate the frontend with Supabase

## Challanges

Being a 10x Dev, I didn't run have any issues implementing this🙂.
